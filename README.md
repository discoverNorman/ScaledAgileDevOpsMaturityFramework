# Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework

>Enterprise transformation without the risk of culture change!

We know that becoming a DevOps organization is hard. Many people will tell you there will be fundamental changes
required in how everything in your organization works. At Scaled Agile DevOps, we believe there is another way.

Using
our exclusive Maturity Framework, you can become a DevOps organization in less than 6 months.

## Benefits of the Framework:

- No need for investing in training teams beyond a few additional daily ceremonies.
- A clear, simple, [42 step release process](#sadmf-release-process) that customers can be assured used DevOps.
- Fully compatible with sending requirements to external development teams.
- Easy to plan 1, 2, or even 3 years worth of detailed deliveries.

## Getting Started

We suggest using the [Certified Really Agile Practitioner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwbiSCgiZNA) training as a method of learning the fundamentals you will need
to be certified SADMF.

## SADMF Release process

At Scaled Agile DevOps, we believe keeping track of so many moving parts is just too much cognitive load. We've
introduced the Release Convoy to simplify things. Why try to track dozens or hundreds of releases per week if we can
simplify it to one large Release Convoy?

## SADMF Metrics

The most important part of any transformation is measuring the productivity increase. We use the follwing metrics:

- **Tasks delivered per developer**: For each developer, the number of tasks they complete during an interation. Developer
  should be focusing on coding. By tracking the number of features each completes, more volume will be produced in each
  iteration. Volume is important. Let's turn it up to 11!
- **SADMF maturity score**: The precise execution of the 42 steps to delivery is critical to the success of SADMF.
  Without "excellent" maturity scores, your customers will have no confidence you used approved SADMF processes to deliver!

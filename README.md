# Scaled Agile DevOps Maturity Framework 2.0

>Enterprise transformation without the risk of culture change!

We know that becoming a DevOps organization is hard. Many people will tell you there will be fundamental changes
required in how everything in your organization works. At Scaled Agile DevOps, we believe there is another way.

Using
our exclusive Maturity Framework, you can become a DevOps organization in less than 6 months.

## Benefits of the Framework:

- No need for investing in training teams beyond a few additional daily ceremonies.
- A clear, simple, manageable [release process](#sadmf-release-process) that customers can be assured used DevOps.
- Fully compatible with sending requirements to external development teams.
- Easy to plan 1, 2, or even 3 years worth of detailed deliveries.

## Getting Started

We suggest using the [Certified Really Agile Practitioner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwbiSCgiZNA) training as a method of learning the fundamentals you will need
to be certified SADMF.

## SADMF Release Convoy

At Scaled Agile DevOps, we believe keeping track of so many moving parts is just too much cognitive load. We need to
"work in small batches." We've
introduced the Release Convoy to simplify things. Why try to track dozens or hundreds of releases per week if we can
simplify it to one large Release Convoy?

Why convoys? Other frameworks have tried to coordinate things with more limited transportation metaphors. However, they were limited to a single direction.
With Release Convoys we have more options. We can turn left or right or even make a U-turn.

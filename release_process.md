# Set Sail with the SAD Delivery Lifecycle!

## Ceremonies

 1. Shipment planning: This is a 5-day meeting held every 6 weeks for planning the next 8 quarters of features to make sure the critical paths are aligned.
 1. Captains' Meeting: Meeting of the Feature Captains to plan the date when the release convoy will be assembled.
 1. Press Gang**. In the Press Gang step, the Feature Captain will choose between 2 and 20 people from the coding pool to "self-organize" around delivering the next feature. This ensures each coder is given the opportunity to work on new and interesting things and that all coders are fully utilized.
 1. Manufacturing: The group of coders assigned to each feature will implement the requirements they are given as rapidly as possible to make sure it can be tested and delivered on the Convoy it is planned for. Once the feature is
 coded, the coders can return to the coding pool to await their next adventure!.
 1. Post Standup Standup**. We understand that only the most important status updates are given in Standup and that
 some defects are lower priority than some features. To address this, we use the Post Standup Standup ceremony. Here
 everyone on the Convoy participates to provide status updates to the Commodore on the lower priority work that is not
 being worked on. To ensure no information is lost through insufficient documentation, each Feature Captian will also
 submit a daily report using the SAD Update form and email it to all participants for review.
 1. Testing: The to keep the coders productive, we need them to focus only on coding. For unit testing, the Feature Captain assigns the complete feature to Unit Testing Team for 100% test coverage.
 1. System Integration Testing: If two teams validating a change are good, three teams are better! This SIT team tests all of the new features of the Convoy together.
 1. Release Convoy: The convoy coordinates transportation of the features that were planned. The Commodore is responsible for keeping the convoy together.
 1. Tribunal: We must "build quality in" by removing things that cause poor quality. In this monthly ceremony we identify and remove the person who created each defect.

 | **Shipment planning**          | 5-day meeting held every 6 weeks for planning the next 8 quarters of shipping                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
 | **Captains' Meeting**          | Meeting of the Feature Captains to plan the date when the release convoy will be assembled                                                                                                                                                                                                |
 | **Press Gang**                 | In the Press Gang step, the Feature Captain will choose between 2 and 20 people from the coding pool to "self-organize" around delivering the next feature. This ensures each coder is given the opportunity to work on new and interesting things and that all coders are fully utilized. |
 | **Testing**               | The to keep the coders productive, we need them to focus only on coding. For unit testing, the Feature Captain assigns the complete feature to Unit Testing Team for 100% test coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
 | **System Integration Testing** | If two teams validating a change are good, three teams are better! This SIT team tests all of the new features of the Convoy together.                                               |
 | **Release Convoy**             | The convoy coordinates transportation of the features that were planned. The Commodore is responsible for keeping the convoy together.                                                                                                                                                  |
 | **Tribunal**                   | We must "build quality in" by removing things that cause poor quality. In this monthly ceremony we identify and remove the person who created each defect.                                                                                                                                |

# Set Sail with the SAD Delivery Lifecycle!
## The Science is Settled
Leveraging Conway's Law to strictly control communication, we empower Human Resources via the Signal Corp to define and control communication plans, pathways, and protocols.  Strict compliance is required, and to democratize this control the Signal Corp and the Human Resources Team will own the agenda iteam in he **MonthlyTribunal**.  Controlling communication controls the system.

 | **Shipment planning**          | 5-day meeting held every 6 weeks for planning the next 8 quarters of shipping                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
 | **Captains' Meeting**          | Meeting of the Feature Captains to plan the date when the release convoy will be assembled                                                                                                                                                                                                |
 | **Press Gang**                 | In the Press Gang step, the Feature Captain will choose between 2 and 20 people from the coding pool to "self-organize" around delivering the next feature. This ensures each coder is given the opportunity to work on new and interesting things and that all coders are fully utilized. |
 | **Unit Testing**               | The Feature Captain assigns the complete feature to Unit Testing Team for 100% test coverage                                                                                                                                                                                              |
 | **System Integration Testing** | Assign complete feature to SIT Team for 100% test coverage. The team writing unit tests is too close to the work and those tests need to be vetting by the SIT team. If two teams validating a change are good, three teams are better.                                                   |
 | **Release Convoy**             | The convoy is coordinate transportation of the features that were planned. The Commodore is responsible for keeping the convoy together.                                                                                                                                                  |
 | **Tribunal**                   | We must "build quality in" by removing things that cause poor quality. In this monthly ceremony we identify and remove the person who created each defect.                                                                                                                                |
